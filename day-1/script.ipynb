Since we're just adding lots of numbers, I could take my big list of numbers, split it into two lists, have one computer core add the first list and have a second computer core add the second list at the same time. Then, I can just add the two results together to get my final result. I'm not limited to two cores; I could split my list up into lots of different sub-lists. It takes some time to set up, but since my cores can do the adding simultaneously, if I'm adding trillions of numbers, I can cut down how much processing time this will take.\n",
