# Advent of Code 2018
I'm jumping into Advent of Code! Each day (-ish), I'll be posting my work here.

I'll each day, I'll post at least two things:
1. A cleaned, polished version of a `.py` script that could be executed.
2. A Jupyter notebook that will detail my thought process, my debugging steps, any exploration/learning I do along the way, and a list of resources I look up.

I'll also post some updates each day on my Twitter: https://twitter.com/matthewbrems/status/1070915623197265920
